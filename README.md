# Python-Mini-Projects

I have created some button projects based on Python. 

#getphone.py : includes the python file to get the details of a phone number, including the geological ac well as the place and time. This can be basically used while tracing a phone number.
Future Scope: This file may be included and used for security measures, to track a number whether the number is active or not and further can be used in cyber security branches.

#motion.py : includes the pyhton file which detects the motion, be it a body or a hand or anything. It can be used in face detection as well as recognition process
