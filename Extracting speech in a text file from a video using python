#We are going to use two libraries for this project:
#Speech Recognition
#MoviePy

pip install SpeechRecognition moviepy

#SpeechRecognition module supports multiple recognition APIs, and Google Speech API is one of them.
#MoviePy is a library that can read and write all the most common audio and video formats, including GIF.

#import libraries.

import speech_recognition as sr 
import moviepy.editor as mp

#export the video from your path
clip = mp.VideoFileClip(r"C:\folder path\video1.mp4")

#import folder for saving the audio file
clip.audio.write_audiofile(r"C:\folder path\converted.wav")

#speech recognition

r = sr.Recognizer()
audio = sr.AudioFile("C:\folder path\converted.wav")
with audio as source:
  audio_file = r.record(source)
result = r.recognize_google(audio_file)

# exporting the result 
with open(r"C:\folder path\recognized.txt",mode ='w') as file: 
   file.write("Recognized Speech:") 
   file.write("\n") 
   file.write(result) 
   print("ready!")
